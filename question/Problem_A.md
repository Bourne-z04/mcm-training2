Background
==========

> As the 2026 FIFA World Cup, featuring the USA, Canada, and Mexico, is
> about to kick off, one of the most globally watched sports events,
> every technological breakthrough and tactical innovation on the World
> Cup field has attracted widespread attention. Looking back at the
> history of the World Cup, set-piece plays have always been a crucial
> factor determining the outcome of matches.

The 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia was known as the \"World Cup of
Set-pieces\". Among the total 169 goals scored, 71 originated from
set-pieces, accounting for a high proportion of 42%. All 30
participating teams scored goals through set pieces, and six direct
free-kick goals even set a new high in recent tournaments. Among these,
in the Group B first-round match between Portugal and Spain, Portuguese
star Cristiano Ronaldo scored a direct free-kick in the 87th minute,
directly breaking the goal and leveling the score at 3-3. With this
goal, he completed a hat-trick, and this classic moment has become a
benchmark case for World Cup free-kick tactics.

Requirements
============

This goal by Ronaldo aroused great interest among people after the
match. The goal video and some materials are attached below. Now, please
consider the following questions:

-   Using the video data, attempt to reconstruct the trajectory of this
    > goal in a spatial coordinate system (with the sides of the
    > football field as coordinate axes and the ground as the coordinate
    > plane), and fit the projected curve on the coordinate plane. Is it
    > possible to obtain the initial velocity of the ball?

-   Currently, typical direct free-kick trajectories include the
    > \"banana kick\", \"knuckleball\" (folhaseca), and \"elevator
    > kick\". Establish dynamic mathematical models for these goal
    > trajectories to conduct research and analyze what type of kick
    > this goal belongs to.

-   For players with strong abilities like Cristiano Ronaldo, regarding
    > direct free-kicks in the attacking half, propose a wall strategy
    > and a goalkeeper\'s defensive strategy.
